        <p>
          Hey! We're Carolina and Stephanie! We're sisters (we know, we look
          nothing alike!) and also mamas to 3 crazies 5 and under, collectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          We love a good book! We're also tired from wrangling littles so getting
          through a book quickly these days is unheard of. We wanted to make a
          space where all tired moms of young and old can come together and share
          their fave book selections, get recommendations and just be a supportive
          space overall. Happy mommin! And happy reading ðŸ“–!
